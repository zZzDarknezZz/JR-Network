Discord Rules
1. No disrespecting other users or staff, we keep stuff chill around here.

2. No hacking / DDoS threats to our users or server of ANY kind!

3. Use common sense and don't be a fucking dumbass

4. If you are asked to leave a channel by a staff member you must do so! If you want someone added to your channel ask a @Server Manager Or @Server Operator 

5. Don't spam in the text chats or mic spam (repeatingly) unless it was allowed by others in that chat. (Voice rooms only, cext chats are NOT allowed to be spammed in).

6. Do not advertize your bullshit PERIOD, if you have another Discord you want your friends to go to/Got some sick merch/Selling your nudes (DM them to Dark), Discord has made a revolutionary thing called "DIRECT MESSAGES" Its mostly used for giving a person something you want to inform them about DIRECTLY... Use it.

7. Do not, either yourself or someone else can give you an IMPROPER rank; bot bank and clearly isn't a bot or having someone else give you staff ranks. (Ban/Warnable)

8. Racism is NOT allowed in text channels! It is in voice!

9. Don't be a dumb fucker using the bot to play CANCEROUS shit, literally sick of hearing VOCAL AUTISM through our music bot. If majority tells you to stop or staff, cut the shit out or you'll be text muted.
Multiple offenses will be permanent.
